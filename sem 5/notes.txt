INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM -> KEY TAKEAWAYS

-> derived class object has the responsibility to initialize all members, including inherited ones
        -> call direct base class constructor
            Wolf->Canine->Animal
            -> if no explicit constructor call is made -> default constructor called

    
-> e.g. create wolf class
        Animal->Canine->Wolf

when there is a possibility of polymorphism always implement a default destructor for the base class

-> for the right destructor to be called when destroying objects of derived class
    virtual ~Base() = default()

The destructors are called from the derived class up to the base class
